# Immunohistochemistry Analysis

This [FIJI](https://imagej.net/Fiji "Fiji") Macro Library allows a user to perform semi-automated quantification of 2D Fluorescent Microscopy Images.

## Macro Library

### Install Macros
 1. Download the .ijm macro files. 
 2. In [Fiji](https://imagej.net/Fiji
    "Fiji"), install the macros by _Plugins > Install..._ and selecting the .ijm file. 
 3. Restart Fiji and the macro will now be an option in the _Plugins_ menu dropdown.

### Process Images
 1. Place Images of Interest from the Same Animal, Slide and Slice in a folder of the form ```mBY15_Slide2_Slice4```
 2. Conform to the naming convention as 
```mBY15/raw_images/mBY15_Slide2_Slice4_11.5X_GFAP.tif``` for Image of Interest
```mBY15/raw_images/mBY15_Slide2_Slice4_11.5X_Control_GFAP.tif``` for Control (Healthy Tissue).
2. Import each Image into FIJI. Insert two Regions of Interest (ROIs) and save as Overlay.
```roi_0_probe``` represents the Locus of Points characterizing Probe Insertion
```roi_background``` represents Brain Tissue hypothesized to be least impacted by Surgical Insult. Used for Normalization of Intensity Levels.

### How to Use Fluorescence Quantification
1. Provide ```ihc-analysis/code/macros/Process_Folder_Fluorescence.ijm``` 
	1. ```input``` with the Input Folder Path
	2. ```output``` with the Output Folder Path
	3. ```macros``` with the Macro Library Path
2. Provide ```ihc-analysis/code/macros/Draw_ROIs.ijm``` with
	1. ```totROIs``` with the number of concentric Regions of Interest (ROIs) to be drawn
	2. ```step``` with the step-size used for drawing concentric ROIs
	3. ```factor``` with Magnification Factor if Calibration Metadata is available externally
3. Run ```ihc-analysis/code/macros/Process_Folder_Fluorescence.ijm``` for each folder of the form ```mBY15_Slide2_Slice4```
4. This will generate results file of the form ```ResultsFluorescence_mBY15_Slide2_Slice4_8056.csv``` in the Output path

### How to Use Cell Counter
1. Provide ```ihc-analysis/code/macros/Process_Folder_Count_Cells.ijm``` 
	1. ```input``` with the Input Folder Path
	2. ```output``` with the Output Folder Path
	3. ```macros``` with the Macro Library Path
2. Provide ```ihc-analysis/code/macros/Count_Cells.ijm``` and ```ihc-analysis/code/macros/Count_Cells_Control.ijm```
	1. ```size``` with the Size Range. Default is set to ```30-300 μm²```
3. Run ```ihc-analysis/code/macros/Process_Folder_Count_Cells.ijm``` for each folder of the form ```mBY15_Slide2_Slice4```
4. This will generate results file of the form ```SummaryCellCount_mBY15_Slide2_Slice4_8056.csv``` in the Output path

## Quantitative Analysis

### Install Python Environment
 1. ```cd ihc-analysis```
 2. ```pip install venv <path-to-virtual-env>```
 3. ```source <path-to-virtual-env>/bin/activate ```
 4. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### How to Use
1. Provide the ```ihc-analysis/code/plots/ihc_config.cfg``` with
	1. ```DIRECTORY``` with the Folder Path to the .csv files to be processed
	2. ```STEP``` with the step-size used for drawing concentric ROIs
2. Run ```python ihc-analysis/code/plots/ihc_plotting.py```
